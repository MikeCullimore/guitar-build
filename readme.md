# guitar-build

What if you had (made!) time to build a guitar? What would you build? What features would it have?

## todo

* Add sketches.

## Feature ideas

* On-board effects.
    * Excuse to use Rust in embedded context?
* Mic out for silent practise.
* Built-in speaker.
* Output signals from each coil in pickup.
    * Allows you to infer which string is being fretted and where.
    * Could measure tuning (and intonation given fret known).
* Easily switch each pickup on/off and flip polarity.
    * E.g. via hyperswitch.
    * Possible via software? (Opens up automatic optimisation.)
* Built-in screen in top edge to read while playing.
